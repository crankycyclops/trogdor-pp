   <!-- Entity class definitions are optional. If they are used, they must
        precede everything else, including the manifest. Entity classes are a
        way to quickly define game Entities that are similar. You define a set
        of attributes for a class, and then any Entity whose type is that class
        will assume those attributes.

        Attributes can be overridden in a specific Entity. So, if you define an
        object class of type "weapon," and you assign to it a damage of 1, but
        then create a specific object of that class and assign to it a damage of
        10, the value of 10 will be used. -->

         <description>
You're standing in the middle of a sprawling white marble castle, the walls lined with portraits of long deceased ancestors of some forgotten king.  Servants are bustling about, rushing around with steaming plates of meats and cooked vegetables, rushing in and out of rooms to serve princes and heads of state. Legend has it that going sideways can transport you to a strange and mystical land.

To the north, you see a dark hole in the wall big enough to walk through.

         <title>Mystical Hall</title>

         <description>
You find yourself in a mystical hall that seems to extend from one horizon to the next. The room is filled with clouds, and if you strain your ears carefully, you think you might hear the sound of an angelic choir.

You can't say for sure, but you suspect that going sideways will return you to the castle.

You're in a dark musty cave.  You see a light some ways off to the south.  To the west, you spy a large dark chamber of some sort.

You find yourself in a dark secluded chamber.  It's dank, musty and generally icky poo-pooos.  Be careful.  There may be nasty things waiting for you here!
