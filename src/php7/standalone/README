A PHP 7 module that allows one or more Trogdor++ games to run in PHP. The original idea behind this was to take advantage of php-fpm to run a game server inside PHP. That won't work, however, because a game only lives inside a single PHP process and the fpm answers web requests using a pool of many available processes, none of which know anything about the others.

This module still lives, however, because it can be useful in the case where you'll only ever use a single PHP process (for example, you might want to use a high level language like PHP to write a game client that runs on a single machine), and because I would still like to explore interesting concepts like passing PHP callbacks (which would require ZTS support) into libtrogdor (so that you could extend a game by writing additional actions in PHP instead of C++.)

At the moment, my interest lies in creating a game server centered around trogdord (coupled with a new PHP module that utilizes it.) That means I'll be leaving this module in an incomplete state, at least for now. In the off chance someone actually cares about it, however, I could be pursuaded to continue development if the price is right ;)

Has been tested and is known to build against PHP 7.2, 7.3, and 7.4.

To build, issue the following commands:

phpize
./configure
make && make install
