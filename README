Trogdor++ is the C++ version of the Trogdor Text Adventure Engine, originally written in C.  That project is no longer maintained, but for historical purposes it can be found here:

https://github.com/crankycyclops/trogdor

For this project, you'll require the following tools:
	- GNU C++ 7 and above or Clang++ 8 and above (if you want to use a different compiler, you're on your own)
	- CMake 3.10 or above
	- LibXML2 (libxml2-dev package on Ubuntu)
	- Lua 5.1+ (lua5.x-dev package on Ubuntu, where 5.x is the version you're compiling against)

By default, trogdor-pp compiles against Lua 5.1, but I've written glue code that enables it to also compile against Lua 5.2+. To set the lua version to something higher than 5.1, just prefix your make command with "LUA_VERSION=5.x".

Build has been tested against Lua 5.1, 5.2, and 5.3.

To install all dependencies in one fell swoop (on Ubuntu 12.04 and up):
$ apt-get install cmake g++ libxml2-dev lua5.x-dev (where 5.x is your preferred Lua version)

Trogdor-pp itself is a library, but in src/standalone, you'll find a simple single player client that demonstrates how it can be used.

To build just the library, issue these commands:

cd /path/to/src
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release .
make trogdor && make install

To build the single player client demo, use these commands:

cd /path/to/src
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release .
make standalone && make install

You don't have to explicitly build the library first. Building the client will build and link to it automatically as a dependency.

To build any of the above targets with GDB debug symbols, add the following option to your cmake command:

-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug

And if you've already built it using debug symbols and want to switch back to a release build without them, use this cmake option:

-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release

If you want to install to somewhere other than the default system path, specify the following option to your cmake command:

-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=/custom/install/path

There is code still in the source tree for an old (and now broken) server/client that I wrote as an exercise to teach myself network programming. The code is bad and should not be used. I'm keeping it (for now) only for historical/archival purposes.

Have fun! :)
