Trogdor++ is the C++ version of the Trogdor Text Adventure Engine, which was written in C.  The original project is no longer maintained.  For historical purposes, it can be found here:

https://github.com/crankycyclops/trogdor

For this project, you'll require the following tools:
	- GNU C++ compiler (if you want to use a different compiler, you're on your own)
	- GNU Make (if you want to use a different build tool, you're also on your own)
	- The boost libraries (libboost-all-dev package on Ubuntu)
	- LibXML2 (libxml2-dev package on Ubuntu)
	- Lua 5.1 (lua5.1-dev package on Ubuntu)

To install all dependencies in one fell swoop (on Ubuntu 12.04 and up):
$ apt-get install make g++ libxml2-dev lua5.1-dev libboost-all-dev

To build a single player wrapper around the core engine, type:

make

To build a version with GDB debug symbols, type:

make debug

Instead of compiling a standalone single-player game, you can also compile a sample (and very poorly written) server/client that allows multi-player network play by typing the commands below. Please be aware that the server and client both use boost::asio, which requires support for pthreads. I had no idea what I was doing when I wrote these components, so use at your own risk ;)

NOTE: the server and client haven't been tested in a VERY LONG TIME and will likely break.

make server (for the backend server that links to the actual trogdor engine)
make client (for the frontend client that talks to the server)
