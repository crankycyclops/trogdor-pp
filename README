Trogdor++ is the C++ version of the Trogdor Text Adventure Engine, which was written in C.  The original project is no longer maintained.  For historical purposes, it can be found here:

https://github.com/crankycyclops/trogdor

Trogdor-pp supports both pthread and boost::thread. To compile with support for pthread, type:

THREAD=pthread make

To compile with support for boost::thread, simply type:

make

Instead of compiling a standalone single-player game, you can also compile a server/client
that allows multi-player network play by typing the following commands (the same optional
THREAD environment variable is accepted):

make server (for the backend server that links to the actual trogdor engine)
make client (for the frontend client that talks to the server)
