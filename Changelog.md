## [0.90.0] - 2021-09-01

### Added

- Added room connection descriptions ([Connection descriptions feature #72 ](https://github.com/crankycyclops/trogdor-pp/pull/72)), a more flexible way to generate room descriptions that can be updated dynamically when those connections change. This new feature shouldn't have any impact on older projects.
